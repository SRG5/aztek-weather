After comparing the monthly costs across West Europe, North Europe, and Germany West Central (using the same service basket: Azure App Service + Azure Front Door + Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server), we selected North Europe as the primary deployment region.
In this comparison, North Europe showed the lowest estimated monthly cost for the selected configuration. In addition, Azure Front Door provides a global entry point that helps reduce latency for users worldwide by leveraging Microsoft’s edge network.
To meet the requirement for maximum availability and minimal impact from failures, the database is configured on the General Purpose tier with High Availability enabled, providing automatic failover and improved resiliency.
